# Recommendation Engine for Prime Video

Today, videos shown to new users on Prime Videoâ€™s home page are manually chosen. You need to implement a recommendation engine to increase the conversation rate.

## Business Questions
- Classify each video into the following buckets: 
  - "Hot" - means trending up. These videos are candidates to be shown.
  - "Stable and Popular" - video view counts are flat, but very high. These videos are candidates to be shown too.
  - "Everything else" - these videos won't be shown.
- What are the main characteristics of the "hot videos"?
- After having identified the characteristics of the hot videos, how would you use this information from a product standpoint?
